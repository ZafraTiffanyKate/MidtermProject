           with "Don't Be Happy", K.Will, with "Peppermint Chocolate", and Geeks, with "Heeheehaheho".  On June 18, the group made 
           their official debut with their first mini-album, Hello, with the title song, "Mr. Ambiguous". Other songs included 
           their per-release songs were included in the album. The song was described as a retro-inspired with a funk rhythm and 
           a blues-rock chord progression, and showcases the group's "bluesy, soulful" voices. Lyrically, 
           it is a warning to "Mr. Ambiguous", a man with confusing behavior who is not honest about his feelings.
